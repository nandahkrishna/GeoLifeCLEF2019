# GeoLifeCLEF2019
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with our team's code for the GeoLifeCLEF 2019 Species Recommendation Challenge. <br> <br>
The original code for the image patch extractor can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/maximiliense/GLC19) and the datasets are available at the challenge's [CrowdAI page](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/lifeclef-2019-geo). <br> <br>
Requirements can be installed by entering the following command in the Terminal:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We achieved a maximum Top30 score of 0.1342 and placed 3rd overall, with our top submission ranking 6th on the leaderboard. This was an XGBoost trained on Spatial Coordinates and Environmental Variable values.
